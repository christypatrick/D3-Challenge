# D3-Challenge - Data Journalism and D3

## Background
This challenge examines the current trends shaping people's lives.  The editor of a major metro paper wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. The editor is counting on the first story to include information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Analysis
For this assignment, a scatter plot has been created with Healthcare vs Poverty as data variables.  D3 technicques were used to create the scatte plot that represents each state with circle elements.  Note:   Use python -m http.server to run the visualization.
